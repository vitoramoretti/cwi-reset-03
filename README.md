## Intro

Welcome to my CWI RESET lv2 repo!
Here I'll be putting all the relevant codes developed during the "RESET" program.
It's mainly for personal record and for the program instructors to have access to the codes.

# Class 1 - "Git, Java Básico e configuração da máquina"
<strong>. October 2nd </strong>

- Group exercise for getting to know each other
- Git config
- GitHub repo creation
- Logic exercises with Java
- Challenge #1 - Debug an app

### Challenge 1 - "Debug a registering machine app"

<p>I did this challenge in two steps. First I analyzed the code to understand what is it calling and made adjustments to get the correct output value in the outcome. <br>
After that, it was time to implement and inventory logic that subtracted the products and responded differently to clients according to their orders and what is in stock.</p>

- Debug code
- Unit testing
- Implementation of inventory

<em>Will watch the resolution of the challeng tonight and make any necessary changes to the code. (October 7th, 2021) </em>
